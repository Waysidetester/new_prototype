                    Brachytherapy offers an important alternative to traditional external 
                    beam radiation and it is often used in conjunction with external beam 
                    radiation in prostate cancer. Published studies indicate that the morbidity 
                    associated with brachytherapy is far less than with surgery and the quality of 
                    life post-procedure is clinically far better.

                    Whether you are a hospital or Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) executive

                    the Prologics Brachytherapy Program. This program can be turnkey and was 
                    designed for facilities to improve their clinical outcomes, eliminate capital 
                    expenses and make it easy for staff to administer as the Prologics team handles 
                    every aspect of the process.

                <h3 class="brachyTitle">Brachytherapy in Ambulatory Surgery Centers</h3>
                <p class="brachyText">
                    Ambulatory Surgery Centers are often operating below capacity. Brachytherapy 
                    is a treatment option that can  increase facility utilization. There are two 
                    common issues that we find working with ASCs. The first is a concern that the 
                    cost of brachytherapy equipment will not fit the capital budget or that the facility 
                    does not currently have the volume to justify the capital expenditure. The second is 
                    staff concern about how a new procedure will change their responsibilities. Our leasing 
                    program alleviates the capital equipment concerns and the Prologics team members take 
                    care of the details required to manage the program.

                <p class="brachyText">
                    Many hospitals that have a long-standing brachytherapy program are unaware of how 
                    changing reimbursement has affected the profitability of their program. If your 
                    facility has a current program in place, our team is available to conduct an assessment 
                    to improve the profitability of this service line.
